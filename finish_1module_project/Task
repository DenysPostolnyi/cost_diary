Try to identify (potentially reusable) building blocks in the starting project and split the app into custom components accordingly
Try not to be too granular when splitting the app

You'll need to listen to three main kinds of events:
    Form submission
    Reset button being clicked
    User input changing (in the various <input /> fields)

Consider using a generic / shared change handler function for the user input events (you don't have to, though)

Manage input state as a single object or as multiple state slices - it's up to you!

Don't forget to "lift state up"

Feel free to change the provided calculateHandler function - maybe the calculation logic can be moved right into the component function?

Related to the previous point: See if you can derive the calculation results from some existing state (instead of managing them as new state)

Consider splitting the provided CSS code into multiple component-scoped CSS files (using "CSS Modules")

Format the currency values output in the table via the below code:
const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
  style: 'currency',
  currency: 'USD',
  minimumFractionDigits: 2,
  maximumFractionDigits: 2,
});

// use like this:
formatter.format(yourValue);
